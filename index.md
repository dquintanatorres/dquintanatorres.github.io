I'm a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.uniovi.es/en/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;">University of Oviedo</a> in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. This is my personal website where I aggregate things like my <a href="../publications/" style="color:blue;">publications</a> and information about <a href="../about/" style="color:blue;">myself</a> and my <a href="../research/" style="color:blue;">current research</a>. Feel free to take a look around!
