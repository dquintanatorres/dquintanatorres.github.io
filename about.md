<div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;">
I'm currently a <b>Postdoctoral Research Fellow</b> in the Cancer Epigenetics and Nanomedicine Group, led by <a href="https://ispa-finba.es/investigacion/cancer/epigenetica-del-cancer-nanomedicina/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;"><b>Prof. Mario Fernández Fraga</b></a>. My main interest is using <b>computational approaches and omics technologies</b> to uncover meaningful insights hidden in biological data.

#### Research

<div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;">
Over the years, I’ve built a well-rounded skill set that bridges both the dry lab (computational) and wet lab (experimental) sides of research. My work mainly focuses on <b>epigenetics and aging</b>, with a particular emphasis on understanding epiproteomic changes that occur as we age. This will contribute to a broader understanding of the regulatory networks that shape epigenetic aging and influence gene expression.

#### Education

<div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;">
I earned my <b>Ph.D. in Biomedicine and Molecular Oncology</b> from the University of Oviedo (Spain) in the group of <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_L%C3%B3pez_Ot%C3%ADn" target="_blank" style="color:blue;"><b>Prof. Carlos López Otín</b></a>. I also obtained my <b>M.S. in Biomedicine and Molecular Oncology</b> and <b>B.S. in Biology</b> at the same university. Recognizing how crucial data analysis has become in biology, I decided to expand my toolkit by pursuing a <b>B.S. in Computer Science</b> at the University of Burgos. Thanks to the program’s flexible distance-learning format (and having a bit less free time), I’ve been able to balance it alongside my research. This interdisciplinary path has truly broadened my perspective and allows me to keep up with today’s fast-paced scientific world. This was made possible thanks to the sponsorship by the <a href="https://www.fundacioncristinamasaveu.com/en/portfolio/beca-de-grado-maria-cristina-masaveu-peterson/" target="_blank" style="color:blue;"><b>María Cristina Masaveu Peterson Bachelor’s Degree Scholarships for Academic Excellence</b></a>.

#### Hobbies

<div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;">
Outside the lab, I’m passionate about football <b>football (soccer)</b> — I played for over 15 years and even reached a semi-professional level before research took center stage during my Ph.D. I also enjoy <b>learning new languages</b> and have completed a four-year elementary degree at the Municipal School of Music (specializing in <b>saxophone</b>) in my hometown. Other hobbies include activities that bring me close to the sea, such as <b>surfing</b> and <b>scuba diving</b> (I hold an Open Water Diver certification).
