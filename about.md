title: About Me

---

Currently, I am a **third-year PhD student** in the Genomics, Cancer, and Aging group, under the leadership of **Prof. Carlos López Otín**. My thesis advisors are Prof. Alicia Rodríguez Folgueras and Prof. Alejandro López Soto. My primary interest lies in leveraging **computational approaches and omics technologies** to derive meaningful insights from biological data.

#### Research

Over the past five years, I have developed a comprehensive skill set encompassing both dry lab (computational) and wet lab (experimental) techniques. My research is primarily centered on **immunology and aging**, more specifically around an in-depth study of the immune system in the context of **accelerated aging (Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome, HGPS)**. This will contribute to a broader understanding of both premature and physiological aging, as well as age-related diseases.

#### Education

I earned my **B.S. in Biology** and **M.S. in Biomedicine and Molecular Oncology** from the University of Oviedo, where I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. Recognizing the increasing relevance of data analysis in biology, I decided to augment my skills with a **B.S. in Computer Science** from the University of Burgos, which provides a flexible distance learning program. This interdisciplinary approach has not only expanded my perspective but also helped me carry out my research. It highlights the importance of a diverse skill set in the rapidly evolving scientific landscape of today. This was made possible by the **María Cristina Masaveu Peterson Bachelor’s Degree Scholarships for Academic Excellence**. I am currently balancing this training during my free time with my Ph.D. research. 

#### Internships

In addition to my main research, I did an internship in the **Biological Analysis Section** (Biotechnological and Biomedical Assays and Photonic Microscopy and Image Processing Units) at the Scientific-Technical Services of the University of Oviedo and in the Cancer Epigenetics and Nanomedicine group led by **Prof. Mario Fernández Fraga**.

#### Hobbies

Outside of academia, I have a passion for **football (soccer)**, having played for over 15 years in different football teams and reaching a semi-professional level. However, due to the demanding nature of biomedical research, I had to step back from this hobby. I also enjoy **learning new languages** and have completed a four-year elementary degree at the Municipal School of Music (specializing in **saxophone**) in my hometown. Other hobbies include activities that bring me close to the sea, such as **surfing** and **scuba diving** (I hold an Open Water Diver certification).
