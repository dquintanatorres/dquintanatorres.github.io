A hallmark of aging, both pathological and physiological, is the disruption of intercellular communication, which ultimately leads to a breakdown in body's homeostasis. This disruption is reflected in the secretion of molecules that have both local and systemic effects on the body's functions. In recent years, researchers have explored various ways to manipulate these circulating factors to delay the aging process. Notably, studies have shown that administering either "old" or "young" plasma to mice can induce or alleviate various aging-associated phenotypes. These findings underscore the importance of systemic factors as potent regulators of aging, either promoting or hindering the process. As a result, researchers are now actively searching for circulating proteins that could serve as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for aging interventions.


### Immune system and aging

As we age, our immune system's ability to protect us from infections and cancer declines due to two interconnected processes: immunosenescence and inflammaging. Immunosenescence manifests as a reduction in immune cell diversity, impaired antigen presentation, and dysfunctional cytokine signaling, making it harder for the body to mount an effective defense against pathogens. Inflammaging, a state of chronic low-grade inflammation caused by senescent cells, further exacerbates this decline by depleting immune cells and promoting chronic inflammation. Targeting these two processes may hold the key to improving aging health and reducing the risk of age-related diseases.
